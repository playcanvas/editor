   ```bash
   npm run develop
   ```

6. **Test the local build** by visiting PlayCanvas Editor with the query parameter:
   ```
   https://playcanvas.com/editor/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID?use_local_frontend
   ```

## Project Structure

```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Keep your branch up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Write clear, concise commit messages**:
   ```
   feat: add new asset inspector component
   
   - Add support for custom asset types
   - Improve preview functionality
   - Update related documentation
   ```

2. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run type:check
   ```

3. **Build the project** to ensure everything compiles:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Follow the existing ESLint configuration (`@playcanvas/eslint-config`)
- Use TypeScript for new files where applicable
- Prefer modern ES6+ syntax
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### CSS/SCSS

- Follow the existing Stylelint configuration
- Use BEM methodology for CSS class naming
- Organize styles by component/feature
- Use SCSS variables for consistent theming

### Code Formatting

The project uses ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript and Stylelint for CSS/SCSS. Run the linters before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Testing for the Editor Frontend is handled through the [playcanvas/editor-test](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-test) repository. Tests are automatically triggered via GitHub Actions workflow when a pull request is labeled with `test`.

The test workflow:
1. Builds a Docker image of the Editor Frontend
2. Runs comprehensive end-to-end tests against the PlayCanvas platform
3. Tests are executed in a containerized environment with access to PlayCanvas services

To run tests on your PR:
1. Ensure your PR is ready for testing
2. A maintainer will add the `test` label to trigger the test suite
3. Monitor the test results in the GitHub Actions tab

### Test Environment

Tests run with the following configuration:
- Docker-based test environment
- Integration with PlayCanvas platform services
- Access to live PlayCanvas editor functionality
- Automated UI and functional testing

### Writing Tests

If you need to add new test cases:
- Tests should be added to the [playcanvas/editor-test](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-test) repository
- Follow the existing test patterns in that repository
- Coordinate with maintainers for test additions

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
   - Reference to any related issues

3. **Respond to feedback** promptly and make requested changes

4. **Ensure CI passes** - all tests and linting must pass

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic (one feature/fix per PR)
- Consider the scope of the feature (wider application = more risk)
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility when possible
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Reuse existing functionality over reimplementation when possible

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs or requesting features:

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the issue templates** when available
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Browser and OS information
   - Relevant console errors or logs
   - Screenshots or recordings when helpful

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **PlayCanvas Forum**: https://forum.playcanvas.com
- **Discord**: Join the PlayCanvas community Discord

## Development Tips

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Development with hot reload
npm run develop

# Build for production
npm run build

# Watch and rebuild CSS only
npm run watch:css

# Watch and rebuild JavaScript only
npm run watch:js

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run type:check

# Serve built files
npm run serve
```

### Editor Integration

- The Editor Frontend integrates with the PlayCanvas platform
- Test changes using the `?use_local_frontend` parameter
- Be mindful of backward compatibility with existing projects

### Performance Considerations

- The Editor handles large scenes and many assets
- Consider performance impact of changes
- Use browser dev tools to profile changes
- Test with complex projects when possible

## Release Process

Releases are handled by the maintainers. Contributors should:

- Ensure changes are well-tested
- Update version numbers only when instructed
- Follow semantic versioning principles
- Document breaking changes clearly

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in release notes and the project's contributor list. We appreciate all forms of contribution, from code to documentation to issue reports.
